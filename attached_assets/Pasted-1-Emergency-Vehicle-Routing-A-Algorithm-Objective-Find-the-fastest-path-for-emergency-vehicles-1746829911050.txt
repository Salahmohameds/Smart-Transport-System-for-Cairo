1. Emergency Vehicle Routing (A Algorithm)*
Objective: Find the fastest path for emergency vehicles (to hospitals F9/F10) considering road conditions and traffic.
Data to Use:

Nodes: Neighborhoods + Facilities (especially F9, F10)

Edges: Existing roads (distance + condition)

Traffic: Time slots from traffic_flows (e.g., avoid roads at 90%+ capacity during peaks)

Implementation Steps:

Heuristic: Euclidean distance to target hospital (use coordinates).

Edge Cost:

python
cost = distance * (1.5 - 0.1 * condition)  # Lower cost for better-condition roads
if traffic_flows[f"{from}-{to}"]["morning_peak"] > 0.9 * capacity:
    cost *= 2  # Penalize congested roads during peaks
Output:

Fastest path from any neighborhood to nearest hospital (e.g., Zamalek (6) → F9).

Compare with Dijkstra’s to show A* efficiency.

2. Public Transit Scheduling (Dynamic Programming)
Objective: Optimize bus/metro schedules to meet demand while minimizing costs.
Data to Use:

Bus routes: bus_routes (B1-B10) and daily passengers

Demand: transit_demand (e.g., 15K passengers from 3→5 daily)

Metro lines: metro_lines (M1-M3)

DP Approach:

State: (time, current_stop, passengers_remaining)

Recurrence:

python
for each bus route B:
    for each time slot t:
        # Allocate buses to routes with highest demand/cost ratio
        value[t][B] = max(value[t-1][B], passengers[B] / buses[B])
Output:

Optimal bus allocation (e.g., assign more buses to B2 which serves 42K passengers).

Metro-bus transfer optimization at hubs like F2 (Ramses Station).

3. Traffic Signal Optimization (Greedy Algorithm)
Objective: Reduce congestion at key intersections during peak hours.
Data to Use:

Traffic flows: traffic_flows (morning/evening peaks)

Road capacities: existing_roads (e.g., road 3-5 has capacity 3500)

Greedy Strategy:

Priority: Intersections with highest traffic-to-capacity ratios.

python
priority_intersection = max(
    (flow["morning_peak"] / capacity 
    for flow, road in zip(traffic_flows, existing_roads)
)
Action: Extend green light time for roads with highest priority.

Output:

Signal timing adjustments (e.g., increase green time for 3-5 during morning peak).

Compare congestion before/after optimization.
