    ### About Economic Analysis
    
    Economic analysis is crucial for transportation planning as it helps:
    
    - Justify infrastructure investments
    - Compare alternative project designs
    - Optimize resource allocation
    - Quantify benefits to society
    - Assess long-term financial sustainability
    
    The analysis uses standard methodologies from transportation economics, including:
    
    - Net Present Value (NPV): The difference between the present value of benefits and costs
    - Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR): The ratio of benefits to costs (> 1.0 indicates economic viability)
    - Internal Rate of Return (IRR): The discount rate at which NPV equals zero
    - Payback Period: The time required to recover the initial investment
